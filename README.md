# GitHub Issues Fiesta! 🎉

Howdy folks, brace yourselves for my inaugural React project! Now, I'm typically a Vue enthusiast, so forgive me if I've thrown in some Vue flavor here and there. Despite my Vue roots, I'm thrilled to announce that diving into React, Apollo, and GraphQL was nothing short of AWESOME!

### The Scoop

This project is like crafting a dazzling client app using React.js and the GitHub GraphQL API. Imagine the spotlight on React.js repo issues—front and center, baby!

#### Unleash the GraphQL Magic

Dive into the GitHub GraphQL API wizardry [here](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer).

### Epic Tasks

#### Task 1: Showtime!

Roll out the red carpet for the [React.js repo issues](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues). Let's make them stars!

#### Bonus Tasks: The Afterparty

##### Task 2: Paging Divas

Implement pagination for a seamless experience. Imagine scrolling through the issues—it's like flipping through a blockbuster script, but better! SCROLLING MAGIC, YAY!

##### Task 3: Filter Frenzy

Create filters for open and closed issues. Because sometimes, you need a little drama in your life.

### Tech Fiesta

- React.js
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS

# Demo Time

Enter the login page and write down your GitHub personal access token to login:

![Login Page](https://github.com/danieelbog/Homelike-GitIs/assets/54244808/f439616c-6e22-41cf-8d82-b669fbf2d575)

If you submit an empty form or with empty spaces, you will get the below message:

![Empty Form](https://github.com/danieelbog/Homelike-GitIs/assets/54244808/f4b291ee-390e-45e2-80c5-7ea73aaf726d)

You can always check the info to familiarize yourself with what I am going to do with your Token. (Probably conquer the whole world)

![Info Page](https://github.com/danieelbog/Homelike-GitIs/assets/54244808/951d6a60-99d3-46b6-88af-fe002890a237)

When you enter the token and it's a valid one, you will enter this page:

![Valid Token Page](https://github.com/danieelbog/Homelike-GitIs/assets/54244808/1c78722e-cfaf-417b-95b9-460244f3e6f5)

You can filter based on Open, Closed, and All issues. And as you scroll down, there is an infinite scroll pagination implemented. (I like it better than the normal pagination, still, the concepts are really close, so don't judge me)

![Filtered Issues](https://github.com/danieelbog/Homelike-GitIs/assets/54244808/9cbb3b41-2b73-455f-bd29-816f86061587)

You can click the arrow to be smoothly scrolled to the top page.
